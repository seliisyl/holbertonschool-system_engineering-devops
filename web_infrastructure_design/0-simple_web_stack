User ➔ Internet ➔ DNS ➔ Web Server (Apache) ➔ Application Server (PHP)➔ **Database Server (MySQL)➔ Response Back to User

How the components work
Server:

A physical or virtual machine that centralizes the processing of user requests and provides the requested resources.
Domain name ( www .foobar .com ):

Provides an easy-to-remember address to access the site instead of using the IP address directly.
DNS record (Type A):

Associates the domain www .foobar .com with the IP address 8.8.8.8 .
Web server (Nginx):

Manages incoming connections, serves static content (images, HTML files), and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
Application server:

Processes backend logic and interacts with the database to respond to user requests.
Database (MySQL):

Stores and retrieves structured information needed by the application.
Communication protocol:

HTTP or HTTPS to ensure reliable communication between the client (browser) and the server.
Infrastructure Weaknesses
Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

If the server goes down, the entire site becomes inaccessible.
Maintenance Outage:

Deploying a new version of the code or restarting the server results in temporary downtime.
Scalability Issue:

A single server cannot handle a high traffic load, which can lead to slowdowns or outages
